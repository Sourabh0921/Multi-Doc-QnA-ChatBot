You havealso studied various terms related to a circle like chord, segment, sector, arc etc.Let us now examine the different situations that can arise when a circle and a lineare given in a plane.\nSo, let us consider a circle and a line PQ. There can be three possibilities given\nin Fig. 10.1 below:\nFig. 10.1\nIn Fig. 10.1 (i), the line PQ and the circle have no common point. In this case,\nPQ is called a non-intersecting  line with respect to the circle. In Fig. 10.1 (ii), there\nare two common points A and B that the line PQ and the circle have. In this case, we\ncall the line PQ a secant  of the circle. In Fig. 10.1 (iii), there is only one point \nA which\nis common to the line PQ and the circle. In this case, the line is called a tangent to the\ncircle.CIRCLES\nReprint 2025-26",

Here the rope\non both sides of the pulley, if considered as a ray, is like a tangent\nto the circle representing the pulley.\nIs there any position of the line with respect to the circle\nother than the types given above? You can see that there cannotbe any other type of position of the line with respect  to the circle.In this chapter, we will study about the existence of the tangentsto a circle and also study some of their properties.\n10.2 Tangent to a Circle\nIn the previous section, you have seen that a tangent* to a circle is a line that\nintersects the circle at only one point .\nTo understand the existence of the tangent to a circle at a point, let us perform\nthe following activities:\nActivity 1 :  Take a circular wire and attach a straight wire AB at a point P of the\ncircular wire so that it can rotate about the point P in a plane. Put the system on a table\nand gently rotate the wire AB about the point P\n to get different positions of the straight\nwire [see Fig. 10.3(i)].\nIn various positions, the wire intersects the\ncircular wire at P and at another point Q1 or Q2 or\nQ3, etc. In one position, you will see that it will\nintersect the circle at the point P only (see position\nAB of AB). This shows that a tangent exists at\nthe point P of the circle. On rotating further, youcan observe that in all other positions of AB, it willintersect the circle at P and at another point, say R\n1\nor R2 or R3, etc. So, you can observe that there is\nonly one tangent at a point of the circle .\nWhile doing activity above, you must have observed that as the position AB\nmoves towards the position A  B, the common point, say Q1, of the line AB and the\ncircle gradually comes nearer and nearer to the common point P. Ultimately, it coincides\nwith the point P in the position A B of AB. Again note, what happens if ‘AB’ is\nrotated rightwards about P? The common point R3 gradually comes nearer and nearer\nto P and ultimately coincides with P. So, what we see is:\nThe tangent to a circle is a special case of the secant, when the two end\npoints of its corresponding chord coincide .Fig. 10.3 (i)Fig. 10.2\n*The word ‘tangent’ comes from the Latin word ‘tangere’, which means to touch and was\nintroduced by the Danish mathematician Thomas Fineke in 1583.\nReprint 2025-26",

Y\nou\nwill find that after some steps, the length ofthe chord cut by the lines will graduallydecrease, i.e., the two points of intersection ofthe line and the circle are coming closer andcloser [see Fig. 10.3(ii)]. In one case, itbecomes zero on one side of the secant and inanother case, it becomes zero on the other sideof the secant. See the positions P Q and PQ\nof the secant in Fig. 10.3 (ii). These are thetangents to the circle parallel to the given secantPQ. This also helps you to see that there cannotbe more than two tangents parallel to a givensecant.\nThis activity also establishes, what you must have observed, while doing\nActivity 1, namely, a tangent is the secant when both of the end points of the\ncorresponding chord coincide.\nThe common point of the tangent and the circle is called the point of contact\n[the point A in Fig. 10.1 (iii)]and the tangent is said to touch  the circle at the\ncommon point.\nNow look around you. Have you seen a bicycle\nor a cart moving? Look at its wheels. All the spokes\nof a wheel are along its radii. Now note the positionof the wheel with respect to its movement on theground. Do you see any tangent anywhere?(See Fig. 10.4). In fact, the wheel moves along a linewhich is a tangent to the circle representing the wheel.Also, notice that in all positions, the radius throughthe point of contact with the ground appears to be atright angles to the tangent (see Fig. 10.4). We shallnow prove this property of the tangent.\nTheorem 10.1 :  The tangent at any point of a circle is perpendicular to the\nradius through the point of contact.\nP\nroof :  We are given a circle with centre O and a tangent XY to the circle at a\npoint P .\n We need to prove that OP is perpendicular to XY .Fig. 10.4Fig. 10.3 (ii)\nReprint 2025-26",

You will find that all\nthe lines through this point intersect the circle intwo points. So, it is not possible to draw any\ntangent to a circle through a point inside it\n[see Fig. 10.6 (i)].\nNext take a point P on the circle and draw\ntangents through this point.
